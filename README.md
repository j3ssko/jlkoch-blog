# Personal Writing/Author Site

A (very) minimal personal website that I used to share publications for my graduate program. It included a blog and was fully responsive.

I've switched over to a Wordpress-managed site, so this one is no longer live.

## Development

Django, Python, HTML, CSS.

## Future Considerations

* Turn on blog
* Custom CMS
