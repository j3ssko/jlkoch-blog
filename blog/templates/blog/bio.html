	<p>J. L. Koch is a writer, currently pursuing her M.F.A through the Stonecoast program at the University of Southern Maine. Her first fiction piece was published in 2017 in the literary magazine <span class="italic">Ghost Parachute</span>.</p>

	<p>She grew up on an island and spent her childhood swimming in the ocean, defying her parents by reading under the covers late at night, and getting stung by bees in the woods behind her house.</p> 

	<p>She spent a semester at Emerson College before transferring to the University of Southern Maine where she graduated with a B.A. in Media Studies.</p>

	<p>After college she spent time living and working in Boston but now lives in Portland, Maine where she works as a front-end developer for a California-based tech company.</p>

	<p>She enjoys drinking coffee, hanging out with other peopleâ€™s dogs, and writing (of course).</p>
